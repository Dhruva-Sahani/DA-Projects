# Machine Learning 

## This folder has 2 projects involving basic maching learning.

- First one is a project involving supervised machine learning. The task is to predict the percentage of a student on the basis of number of hours studied using the Linear Regression supervised machine learning algorithm.
- Second one is a project involving unsupervised machine learning. The task to predict the optimum number of cluster for the iris data set .iris data set consists of 3 types of flower namely Iris-setosa Iris-versicolour and Iris-virginica

Both of these problem statements and their datasets were aquired from the Sparks Foundation Internship program. They've been performed using python in jupyter notebooks
