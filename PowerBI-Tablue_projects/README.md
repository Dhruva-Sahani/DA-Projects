- #### Data visualization is a very essential part of data analytics which involves presenting the results of your analysis to the audience

I've made a very basic visualization using Microsoft Power-Bi. It shows the sales and profits of an e commerce company over the course of 2 years. This is an interactive visualization i.e. there are multiple factors present in the the visualization which can be selected according to the users to show the necessary data. 
The dataset used to create this project has been added to the folder as well
